# Traefik Online Meetup: Keep the Routing Simple

Registration [here](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_vFoNm8dLTCefZkMmeSeNlg).

Traefik: Keep the Routing Simple by Damien Duportal, Developer Advocate of Containous.

This Meetup presents a simple Traefik usage on a single cloud server for hosting personal applications. 

During this 45 minute session, Damien will demonstrate how Traefik is easy to use, and dig into the Let’s Encrypt and Docker use case. We’ll go a bit deeper than a “Hello world,” but not to the depth of a complicated “Enterprise” use case. This inaugural Traefik Online Meetup will be valuable to beginners, newcomers, and advanced users who are interested in a “back to basics,” routing instructional demo. 

During Damien’s demo, he will cover different backend applications such as personal blogs, personal git servers, personal Jenkins, and personal websockets applications.

We hope you’re able to join us, and ask questions in this learning forum!
